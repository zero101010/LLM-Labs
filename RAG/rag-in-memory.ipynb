      "1.  **Moscato d'Asti:** This is probably the most approachable and common sweet Italian wine. It's very light, bubbly, and bursting with intense aromas of peach, apricot, and orange blossom. It’s incredibly refreshing and often served chilled. It’s the *go-to* choice for a light, easy-drinking sweet wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Recioto della Valpolicella:** Made from Corvina grapes, this is a richer, fuller-bodied sweet red wine. It typically exhibits flavors of blackberry, cherry, and cocoa. A great wine for chocolate desserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Passito di Pantelleria:** Produced from Zibbibco grapes, this wine is intensely sweet, with flavors of dates, figs, and honey. It's a truly unique and concentrated experience.\n",
